# music-recommender
Made for repl.it's July 2019 Music-themed competition

Made in ~1 hour, super basic music recommender that lets you input an album or genre and gives you a list of music you might enjoy.

Future features: Read/write file for users to add to the database, more definition/nuance between genres
